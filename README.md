# donotresetmypassword
I usually need to log in with my apple ID and don't want anyone to be able to access my personal 
info, so I wrote this to log me out, removes all files then removes my user.

# Install
1. Modify "donotresetmypassword" and replace 'username="your_user_name"' with your actual username.
2. double click install

That's it!

# Uninstall
Just run "uninstall" file

# Note
If you want to change your password, just uninstall then install after you're done.
